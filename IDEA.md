For those like me who want to form better habits.

### Task

Build a habit tracker with streak counting, statistics, and beautiful visualizations. Include daily reminders and a calendar view. Use a gamified UI to encourage consistency. Use AI to help users achieve their goals,  whether it be to form or break habits. *Going forward I will use `going to the gym` and `quitting vaping/smoking` as the prime examples of `good` and `bad` habits (respectively).

### Thought process

When people want to quit their bad habits they first need to see *scientifically* (aka on a graph) how bad their habit really is, or how much the good habit being formed would benefit them (even in various way). *This is where AI will come into play*, it needs to be able to, on the spot, create a completely customized habit tracker dashboard. ***WHICH SHOULD BE DIFFERENT FOR EVERY SINGLE USER EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY INPUT A NEW HABIT***

### Bahai principals are universal

We should always strive to serve others through our professions...

#### So how does this help people?

Well if you think about it, it has the potential to be a microcosm of therapy. If we give AI all the context from every single habit saved to that user's profile, it can really talk with, encourage, and most importantly **express empathy** to not let the user get discouraged.

That's all I got. You take over from here, focus on really make an application for the good of the people, something everyone can benefit from. If you ever hit a crossroads in what decision to make from the business perspective, just ask yourself "What would Abdul Baha do?"...
