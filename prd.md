# PRD: InspireAI

## 1. Product overview
### 1.1 Document title and version
- PRD: InspireAI
- Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary
InspireAI is an intelligent habit-tracking application designed to empower users on their journey of personal growth. It goes beyond simple tracking by leveraging artificial intelligence to provide personalized, data-driven insights and empathetic support. For each habit a user wants to form or break, the application generates a unique, customized dashboard with scientific information and visualizations that illustrate the habit's impact on their well-being.

This tool is more than a utility; it's a companion. The core of the experience is an AI coach that offers encouragement, celebrates progress, and helps users navigate setbacks with genuine empathy. By combining a beautiful, gamified user interface with powerful AI, we aim to make the process of building a better life not just manageable, but also inspiring and deeply rewarding.

## 6. Narrative
Sam is a graphic designer in his early 30s who wants to quit vaping but feels trapped by the habit. He's tried generic tracking apps before, but they just made him feel guilty when he failed. He stumbles upon this tool and decides to give it a try. When he adds "quit vaping" as his goal, he's amazed to see the app instantly create a dashboard showing not just the money he'll save, but a timeline illustrating how his body will healâ€”showing milestones for lung function recovery and reduced risk of heart disease. For the first time, his goal feels tangible. When he has a tough day and logs a craving, the AI coach doesn't just show a red 'X'. Instead, it says, "It's okay, Sam. Acknowledging a craving is a step in itself. What was the trigger? Let's think of a strategy for next time." This empathetic interaction makes him feel understood, not judged, empowering him to keep going and ultimately succeed.
